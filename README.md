# agents-manifest

Agent Manifest â€” A specification for machine-readable service descriptions designed for AI agents. Similar to robots.txt but for the agentic era, providing structured information about APIs, authentication, payment methods, and more.

## Overview

Agent Manifest allows developers to describe the key capabilities and entry points of a service for intelligent agents. Instead of leaving these agents clueless about how to interact with your web application or website, you provide a structured file containing information about APIs, response formats, authentication methods, and (if necessary) payment instructions.

## Analogy with robots.txt

The robots.txt file is used by search engine crawlers to understand which pages or sections of a site should be indexed or ignored. In a similar way, an "agent manifest" (for example, a file named agents.json) works as a guide for AI-driven agents, indicating which actions they can perform, which resources are available, and how authentication or payment should be handled.

## Usage for Regular Websites

You can think of an agent manifest as an expanded version of a site map, offering additional metadata specifically for AI agents. Alongside a list of pages or services, you can specify:

- Detailed endpoints (e.g., /api/users, /api/products)
- Recommended usage scenarios (e.g., "Use this endpoint for user onboarding")
- Authentication workflows (e.g., OAuth2 or API tokens)
- Payment options (e.g., stripe api, or crypto payment)

This approach lets agents understand both the structure of your website and the specifics of each endpoint, reducing guesswork and making automated interactions more reliable.

## Key Technical Requirements

- Must be a UTF-8 encoded plain text file in JSON format
- Must be located at a well-known location:
  - Primary: `/agents.json` at the root directory (e.g., `example.com/agents.json`)
  - Alternative: Can be specified via HTTP header `X-Agent-Manifest: <URL>`
- File size should not exceed 2MB
- Must return content-type `application/json`
- Must be publicly accessible without authentication (the manifest file itself)
- Can use HTTP caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `ETag`)
- Should handle conditional requests (If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match)
- Must maintain backwards compatibility within major versions
- Should be served over HTTPS
- Can reference additional files for detailed documentation (similar to sitemap.xml references)
- Must be valid JSON and parseable by standard JSON parsers
- Should include a required minimal set of fields:
  - version
  - last_modified
  - supported_agent_versions
